# BeatSketch

## Overview
BeatSketch is a lightweight script designed to streamline the pre-production phase of music projects. It allows composers, producers, and musicians to quickly sketch out the structure of a track, including time signatures, tempo changes, and sections such as intro, verse, chorus, etc. This tool aims to simplify the workflow in Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) by providing a clear roadmap for recording and production.

## Features
- Define and organize music sections (Intro, Verse, Chorus, etc.)
- Set tempos and time signatures for each section
- Generate a MIDI file to import into any DAW
- Easy-to-use interface for quick music sketching

## Usage
1. Define your song structure in a simple JSON format.
2. Run the script to generate a MIDI file.
3. Import the MIDI file into your DAW to guide your recording and production process.
